## Introduction

Welcome to the README for our Full Stack Web Application project! This project was developed as part of a class assignment using Node.js, Express framework, Bootstrap 5, SQLite3 database, npm sessions for user management, and npm geocoder for tracking user locations. The project aims to provide a simple and intuitive user interface (UI) with a focus on excellent user experience (UX). The project utilizes various UX elements implemented through custom CSS and SCSS. The web pages are rendered using Pug, an HTML templating engine.
